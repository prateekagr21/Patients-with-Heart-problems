# Patients with Heart problems.

# Predicted the Heart Disease using Machine Learning Algorithms !

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have now become the leading cause of mortality in India.

A quarter of all mortality is attributable to CVD.

Ischemic heart disease and stroke are the predominant causes and are responsible for more than 82% of CVD deaths.

While you can't change some risk factors â€” such as family history, sex or age

But still there are plenty of ways you can reduce your risk of heart disease.

1. Take control of your blood Pressure

2. Take a note on your Cholestrol

3. Take care of your eating habits.

4. Exercise is a must

5. Quit smoking, if you do

6. Try avoidin getting diabetes

7. A good night sleep will do no much harm.

# In this Machine Learning Project, what i did was -

- Taken the dataset and checked for Null Values
- Visualized the Considerable Factors
- Finded the correlation
- Trained my Model using RandomForestClassifier
- And Then improved it's Score by using K-Nearest Classifier and Plotted the Classification scores graph !
